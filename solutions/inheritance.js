/**
 * In this challenge, we practice implementing inheritance and use JavaScript prototypes to add a new method to an existing prototype.
 * Provided is the implementation for a Rectangle class.  Perform the following tasks:
 * 
 * 1. Add an area method to Rectangle's prototype
 * 2. Create a Square class that satisfies the following:
 *  - It is a subclass of Rectangle.
 *  - It contains a constructor and no other methods.
 *  - It can use the Rectangle class' area method to print the area of a Square object.
 */

  constructor(height, width) {

  /**
   * Write code that adds an 'area' method to the Rectangle class' prototype

  /**
   * Create a Square class that inherits from Rectangle and implement its class constructor
